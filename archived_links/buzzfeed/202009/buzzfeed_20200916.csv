/watch/video/113512,"The Cast Of ""Woke"" Plays Who's Who
The cast of Hulu's new original comedy series ""Woke"" (Lamorne Morris, Sasheer Zamata, Blake Anderson, and T. Murph) played a game of “Who's Who” to find out which superlatives matched them best; from who’s most likely to forget their lines, to who’s getting caught napping in a corner, all the way to which one of them is most likely to *actually* have conversations with inanimate objects.
