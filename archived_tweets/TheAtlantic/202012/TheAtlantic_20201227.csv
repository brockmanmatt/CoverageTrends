We’re revisiting his list and looking back at what he wrote about some of the films when they were first released. https://t.co/K4W1yDbU9c,1343275712388755458,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/12/10-best-films-of-2020/617351/,Sun Dec 27 19:21:01 +0000 2020
0,TheAtlantic,"2/ “Da 5 Bloods” centers on four Black Vietnam War veterans. Though it was made before the summer’s global protests against police brutality, “the sentiment feels urgent,” Sims wrote. The film also marks one of Chadwick Boseman’s final roles. https://t.co/KZuf3M5d3d",1343275713743495170,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/06/da-5-bloods-spike-lees-most-ambitious-film/612952/,Sun Dec 27 19:21:01 +0000 2020

0,TheAtlantic,"4/ Charlie Kaufman’s “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” is more than a psychological-horror film.

0,TheAtlantic,"5/ Yes, David Fincher’s “Mank”' chronicles the creation of “Citizen Kane,” but the film also “interrogates the fragile dynamic between creator and mogul that’s essential to the Hollywood business of hammering art into commerce,” Sims wrote. https://t.co/omjSKuZN6Q",1343275717816184832,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/11/mank-david-fincher-review/617012/,Sun Dec 27 19:21:02 +0000 2020
