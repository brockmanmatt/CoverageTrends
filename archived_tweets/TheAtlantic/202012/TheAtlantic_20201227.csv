0,TheAtlantic,1/ This month our critic @davidlsims picked the 10 best films of 2020. We’re revisiting his list and looking back at what he wrote about some of the films when they were first released. https://t.co/K4W1yDbU9c,1343275712388755458,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/12/10-best-films-of-2020/617351/,Sun Dec 27 19:21:01 +0000 2020
0,TheAtlantic,"2/ “Da 5 Bloods” centers on four Black Vietnam War veterans. Though it was made before the summer’s global protests against police brutality, “the sentiment feels urgent,” Sims wrote. The film also marks one of Chadwick Boseman’s final roles. https://t.co/KZuf3M5d3d",1343275713743495170,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/06/da-5-bloods-spike-lees-most-ambitious-film/612952/,Sun Dec 27 19:21:01 +0000 2020
0,TheAtlantic,"3/ Chloé Zhao’s “Nomadland” is “a worthy exploration of the lost American dream, focusing on communities laid to waste by an economic crisis the country has already begun to forget.” The Frances McDormand–led film was a fall must-watch. https://t.co/J8lQRKgsEU",1343275715047944192,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/american-utopia-one-night-in-miami-nomadland-mlk-fbi-fall-movies/616381/,Sun Dec 27 19:21:01 +0000 2020
0,TheAtlantic,"4/ Charlie Kaufman’s “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” is more than a psychological-horror film. It’s worth rewatching: “There’s a weird thrill to getting lost inside … only so you can study every odd detail from new angles, over and over again.” https://t.co/v6HHYiUbbf",1343275716461387778,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/im-thinking-of-ending-things-charlie-kaufman-review/615970/,Sun Dec 27 19:21:02 +0000 2020
0,TheAtlantic,"5/ Yes, David Fincher’s “Mank”' chronicles the creation of “Citizen Kane,” but the film also “interrogates the fragile dynamic between creator and mogul that’s essential to the Hollywood business of hammering art into commerce,” Sims wrote. https://t.co/omjSKuZN6Q",1343275717816184832,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/11/mank-david-fincher-review/617012/,Sun Dec 27 19:21:02 +0000 2020
