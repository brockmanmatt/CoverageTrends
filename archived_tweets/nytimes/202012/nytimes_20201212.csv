0,nytimes,"“How common will these reactions be?” 

They’re rare. In Pfizer’s late-stage clinical trial, just one of the 18,801 vaccine recipients had a severe reaction. In Britain, both patients had a history of anaphylaxis, and both recovered following treatment. https://t.co/BpLgtqKaEI",1337865368501694464,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/health/Covid-Pfizer-vaccine-allergies.html,Sat Dec 12 21:02:14 +0000 2020

People with a history of anaphylaxis to any vaccine were excluded from Pfizer's studies.

In the U.S., the FDA will require Pfizer to increase its monitoring for anaphylaxis and submit data on it. https://t.co/BpLgtqKaEI",1337865677387001857,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/health/Covid-Pfizer-vaccine-allergies.html,Sat Dec 12 21:03:28 +0000 2020

No. Fewer than one in a million recipients of other vaccines a year in the U.S. have an anaphylactic reaction.

Reactions are treatable, and much easier to control than a severe case of Covid-19. https://t.co/BpLgtqKaEI",1337866139813236739,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/health/Covid-Pfizer-vaccine-allergies.html,Sat Dec 12 21:05:18 +0000 2020
